## Neural Style Transfer

Implementation of Neural Style Transfer from the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) in Keras 2.0+

INetwork implements and focuses on certain improvements suggested in [Improving the Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04603).

Color Preservation is based on the paper [Preserving Color in Neural Artistic Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05897).

Masked Style Transfer is based on the paper [Show, Divide and Neural: Weighted Style Transfer](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/208_Report.pdf)
